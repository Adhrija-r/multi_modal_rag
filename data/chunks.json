Headline inflation will\nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.\nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in\n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5\u00bd percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses\nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar\u2019s LNG production expands massively,\nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share\nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall.\nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to\n20 percent and return on equity of 14\u00bd percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.\nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks\u2019 net short-term foreign liabilities,\nbanks\u2019 non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average\nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding.

Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to\nlower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform\nmomentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3).\nOutlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-\nterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and\nreform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far\nbeen resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall.\nQatar\u2019s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks.\nFiscal policy: The authorities\u2019 commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The\npositive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to\nintroduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending\nefficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient\nspending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term\nfiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will\nenhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency\nand risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.\nMonetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country\nwell. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the\nrecent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and\nformalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding\nthrough market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks\u2019 exposure to sh"

Qatar has started the implementation of the much anticipated Third National\nDevelopment Strategy (NDS3) to chart a new course for economic transformation (Text\nFigure 1). Driven by significant public infrastructure investment over the last decade, Qatar\u2019s non-\nhydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output. Diversification\nin fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor\nproductivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3\n(launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model\nto a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to\nbuild a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and\n\u201cdiversification clusters\u201d identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I).

By matching\nthe occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with\nthe AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure\nand complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the \u201cgrowth clusters\u201d identified in NDS3\u2014\nmanufacturing, logistics, and tourism\u2014tend to have more limited AI exposure.\nScenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff\nanalysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital,\ninnovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and\nfaster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt\nannually (above the baseline) over the medium term.\nLabor Productivity by AI Scenarios\n(Million GDP per worker)\n0.5\nPessimistic\nBaseline\n0.4 Optimistic\nVery optimistic\n0.3\n0.2\n2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 2027 2029\nSources: IMF staff calculations.\n1 This box summarizes key findings in the Selected Issues Paper \u201cArtificial Intelligence in Qatar: Assessing the Potential\nEconomic Impacts.\u201d\n2 Pizzinelli et al. 2023, \"Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences and Distributional Implications\"\nAuthorities\u2019 Views\n34.

The\nauthorities are fully committed to meeting the IMF standards under the Enhanced General Data\nDissemination System (e-GDDS). Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps\nremain in the coverage and granularity of fiscal and external statistics, especially for the International\nInvestment Position (including QIA positions), FDI and portfolio investment. The strong emphasis on\ndata in NDS3 is encouraging, and the NPC is working to enhance inter-agency coordination for data\ncollection and dissemination.

The authorities welcomed the IMF\u2019s initiative to strengthen data adequacy and agreed\nwith staff assessment. They noted that the establishment of the national statistics center under the\nNPC would enhance data collection and dissemination and expressed interest in collaborating with\nthe IMF, including through TA. The gaps in external sector statistics were well recognized, and the\nNPC stressed that strong efforts were underway to enhance FDI data, which is also important for\nmonitoring and assessing progress in NDS3 initiatives.\nSTAFF APPRAISAL\n37. Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to\nexternal shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has\nbottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The medium-\nterm outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated\nbenefits from NDS3 implementation.

To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is\nimportant to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing\nout the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private\nsector-led growth.

Maintaining diligent supervision is important especially for banks with weaker\nasset qualities. Formalizing the financial safety net would further enhance financial stability. The QCB\nshould continue to review its macroprudential policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential\nmacro-financial risks. Guided by FSS3, efforts to develop domestic capital market should accelerate,\nwhich would also help banks reduce their reliance on public sector deposits and exposure to short-\nterm foreign funding. Qatar\u2019s excellent efforts in fighting financial crimes should continue.\n40. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The QCB should continue to adjust\nits policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve while improving its liquidity forecasting. Over\ntime, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, promoting a more active\ninterbank market, and allowing fully market-based bank lending interest rates would enhance\nmonetary policy transmission. Qatar\u2019s external position in 2023 was assessed to be moderately\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.\n41.

Attracting and retaining high-\nskilled expatriate workers, enhancing the nationals\u2019 talent and employment in the private sector, and\nfurther benefiting from the female talent will enhance human capital.

Overview of Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy\nThis Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets\nthe priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state\u2019s role as\nan enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and\nchallenges associated with a state-driven growth model.\n1. Qatar\u2019s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation\ntoward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure\n1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar\u2019s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From\nNDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar\u2019s diversification strategy has gradually\ntransitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the\nprivate sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage\nQatar\u2019s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human\ncapital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic\ntransformation, with ambitious targets set.\n2. NDS3 highlights Qatar\u2019s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision\n2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and\ninstitutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008\u201323\n(average 5\u00bd percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10\npercentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar\u2019s education and health systems, labor market including\nfor expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.\n3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar\u2019s\ndiversification journey. Qatar\u2019s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC\ncountries, especially in fiscal revenue and expo"

NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-\nhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification\nmodel driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and\nincentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and\nhighly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains\nless skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an\nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further\ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic\ndiversification.\n4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an \u201cenabler\u201d of more vibrant and\nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close\nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the\nneed to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through\nadditional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to\nfacilitate private sector participation. It also identifies \u201cdiversification clusters\u201d to build comparative\nadvantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.\n42 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND"

External Sector Assessment\nOverall Assessment: Qatar\u2019s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained\nrobust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In\n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical\nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to\nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in\nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current\naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing.\nPotential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged\nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap.\nFiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and\nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the\nexternal position in the medium term.\nForeign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory\nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and\nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities\nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but\nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central\nbank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.\nAssessment. On the asset side, QCB\u2019s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are\nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023\u2014they will continue "

Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar\nThis Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to\nQatar\u2019s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well\nand point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the\nmachine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.\n1. Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the\nofficial data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic\nindicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy\nmakers and businesses may need a more timely\nFigure III.1.

A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar\u2019s nowcasting framework to optimize\nthe variable and model selections:\n\u2022 A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential\npredictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts.\nUnlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this\napproach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in\neconomic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon GDP.\nSpecifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying\nrelevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its\nkey trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related\nto Qatar\u2019s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are\nrun against Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive\nand negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari\neconomy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to\n13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley\ndecomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative\nvariables and iterate with alternative variables.\n\u2022 Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets.
